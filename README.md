# FitLit
## üìù Description
FitLit is an app that displays a user's fitness data with graphs to encourage healthy habits.  

## Context
FitLit is our first group project from Module 2 at Turing School of Software & Design.  It was completed over the course of two weeks.  During Week 1 we designed and built a fitness app from scratch. In Week 2 we went back and made our app more accessible by refactoring the HTML to be more semantic and read well with a screenreader. We added a drag and drop widget feature to our page so that a user can rearrange the cards on the page.



### User Experience Design Process: 

At the start of the project we combined several design inspirations and came up with a wireframe for our User-Interface.  

We did usability testing to learn more about what parts of our site were unclear to first-time users and revised the html and css to be more legible.  

### Use of Web APIs:  

We learned to implement 3rd party javascript libraries including chart.js and SortableJS. 

This project was our first chance to practice accessing and updating API datasets using GET and POST requests.  


## Learning Goals and Objectives
### Week One:
1. Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation.  
2. Create a user interface that is easy to use and displays information in a clear way.  
3. Write DRY, reusable code that follows SRP and trends toward function purity. 
4. Implement a robust testing suite using TDD.  
5. Make network requests to retrieve data.  
6. Collaborate productively and professionally as a team. Ensure all team members are able to be heard and contribute throughout the project.

### Week Two:
1. Work with a local server and make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data.  
2.  Ensure your app follows best practices for accessibility.  
3.  Implement feedback from a usability test to improve product.
